## Technology Stack

The project is built using the following technologies:

-   **Central Design System**: CDS is a full-fledged framework built on top of Vue.js.

-   **Vue 3**: Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework that enables us to build user interfaces efficiently. The latest version, Vue 3, brings additional features, improved performance, and enhanced scalability to the application.

-   **Pinia**: Pinia is a state management library designed specifically for Vue.js. It helps us manage the application's state in a more organized and scalable manner.

-   **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, adding static typing to the language. Using TypeScript enhances the development process by catching type-related errors early and improving code maintainability.

-   **Vitest**: Vitest is a popular JavaScript testing framework that allows us to write and execute unit tests to ensure the stability and correctness of our codebase.

-   **Feature-Sliced Design**: FSD is an architectural methodology for scaffolding front-end applications.
